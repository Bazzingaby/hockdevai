Field Hockey Context‑Aware Analytics System
Introduction

The goal of this project is to design a complete, context‑aware field‑hockey analytics system that can ingest raw match footage, detect and track players and the ball, map movements to metric pitch coordinates and automatically extract events such as passes, circle entries or shots. The system should provide coaches, analysts and fans with rich statistics, heat‑maps, interactive replays and even drive a 3‑D game‑engine. Building such a product requires research into the rules of hockey, physics of ball motion, player positions, state‑of‑the‑art computer‑vision models and scalable cloud architecture. This report summarises the required background, outlines a data and model pipeline, presents a database and system design, and gives step‑by‑step guidance for implementation.

Field dimensions and rules

Hockey is played on a rectangular pitch 91.40 m long and 55 m wide. Long side‑lines mark the 91.40 m perimeters and shorter back‑lines mark the 55 m ends. A centre line is marked across the middle, and 23 m lines are drawn 22.90 m from each back line. The penalty spots (150 mm in diameter) are 6.40 m from the inner edge of the goal‑line. A circle is created by a straight 3.66 m line parallel to the back line and arcs of 14.63 m radius drawn to meet the back line, forming a quarter‑circle “D”. Broken lines are marked 5 m outside the circle to enforce the 5 m defending distance. The goals are 3.66 m wide and 2.14 m high, with side boards and back boards surrounding the net.

Field hockey is played by two teams of eleven players, including goalkeepers. Substitutions may occur at any time except during a penalty corner. The Field Hockey Study Guide describes typical positions: goalkeeper, fullbacks, halfbacks, midfielders, wings and centre forward. Offensive players often rotate between wings and centre, while defenders generally maintain their positions. Goals may only be scored when an offensive player hits the ball from inside the striking circle (about 16 yards from the goal).

The official rules specify that all field lines are 75 mm wide, form part of the field of play and should be marked in white【175877195414309†L2431-L2424】. Run‑off areas of at least 3 m at the ends and 2 m along the sides are recommended. These dimensions serve as ground truth for homography calibration and metric coordinate mapping within the analytics system.

Visualising the field and positions

【eddb37333e5b8f78dae89d73c1617a70.jpg†embed_image】The diagram above shows the minimum pitch dimensions used in hockey (all numbers in millimetres). It highlights the 91.40 m × 55 m pitch, 23 m lines (labelled 22.90 m), 14.63 m arcs for the circle, the 3.66 m goal width and 2.14 m goal height, together with a front and side view of the goal.

【large.png†embed_image】Another visualisation illustrates traditional player positions: goalkeeper, fullbacks (left and right backs), halfbacks (left half and right half), midfielders (centre half, inside left and inside right) and strikers (left wing, centre forward and right wing). Modern tactical systems allow players to interchange roles, but these labels remain useful when annotating data and designing analytics for team shapes.

Data collection and annotation
Sources and ingestion

Video acquisition: Use rights‑cleared match footage (club, university or federation broadcasts). Begin with a single elevated sideline camera covering the full field; additional goal‑line cameras can be added later for circle events.

Storage: Upload raw videos to a Google Cloud Storage bucket (e.g., gs://hockeyvision/raw/{source}/{match_id}/video.mp4). On upload, a small VM or Cloud Run service can extract clips or frames via ffmpeg and write a JSON metadata file containing match, team and camera information.

Sampling strategy: Sample densely (25–30 fps) around interesting events and sparsely (2–5 fps) elsewhere to reduce labeling costs.

Pitch template: Store an SVG or JSON representation of the official pitch with all dimensions (91.40 m × 55 m, 23 m lines, 3.66 m circles, penalty spots, etc.), derived from the FIH rules. This template is used for homography and for overlay rendering.

Annotation tools and schemas

To train detectors, segmenters, trackers and event classifiers, the system needs labelled data. Open‑source labelling tools such as Label Studio or CVAT are recommended; they can be hosted on Kubernetes and integrated with Google Cloud Storage. The labelling schema should include:

Object detection (YOLO): classes for player, goalkeeper, umpire, stick, ball, goal, scoreboard and optional coach/bench. Each annotation should carry attributes such as team ID, jersey number (to be extracted via OCR later), visibility and occlusion.

Semantic/instance segmentation: pixel masks for pitch, lines (centre, 23 m lines, circles, sidelines, back lines), circle areas and penalty spots. Synthetic augmentation (drawing lines on turf textures) can bootstrap segmentation models.

Tracking and re‑identification: assign persistent track IDs across frames and store Re‑ID embeddings (e.g., from OSNet). This preserves player identity through occlusions and camera cuts.

Events: label high‑level actions (pass, reception, carry, circle entry, 23 m entry, penalty corner, penalty stroke, free hit, long corner, turnover, interception, shot, save, rebound, goal, card) with timestamps and metric coordinates. A minimal JSONL example is shown below:

{
  "match_id": "CUL-2025-10-15",
  "clip_start_s": 312.4,
  "events": [
    {"t": 312.63, "type": "pass", "from_tid": "HOM-7", "to_tid": "HOM-11", "x": 34.2, "y": 18.1, "qual": "ground"},
    {"t": 314.12, "type": "circle_entry", "team": "home", "x": 47.9, "y": 6.3},
    {"t": 315.31, "type": "shot", "body": "forehand", "outcome": "save"}
  ]
}


The Field Hockey PhD thesis (2024) emphasises that CNNs such as YOLO and R‑CNN have been adapted and trained specifically for field‑hockey scenarios and that annotated datasets are essential for training
s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
. It also highlights the importance of real‑time processing and integration with broadcast systems

.

Dataset organisation

Store data in the following structure in Google Cloud Storage:

gs://hockeyvision/
  raw/…                     # original videos
  01_staging/frames/{match_id}/{clip_id}/{frame_ts}.jpg
  02_labels/
    detection_yolo/{split}/images, labels
    segmentation/{split}/images, masks
    events/{split}/clips, annotations.jsonl
  03_calib/   # homography keypoints, line endpoints per clip
  04_metadata/# per‑match JSON: teams, kit colours, camera parameters

Model suite and training pipeline
Detection, segmentation and tracking

Object detector: Use the YOLOv8/YOLOv9 series for detecting players, goalkeepers, umpires, balls, sticks and goals. The field‑hockey thesis demonstrates that YOLO‑based models trained on custom datasets achieve high precision and recall and can detect small, fast balls
s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
. Training can be performed using Vertex AI’s custom training jobs (PyTorch container) with hyper‑parameter tuning.

Tracker and Re‑ID: The ByteTrack algorithm associates almost every detection box (including low‑score boxes) to recover true objects and reduce fragmented trajectories; the authors show that ByteTrack improves IDF1 scores and achieves state‑of‑the‑art MOTA on MOT benchmarks
arxiv.org
. Combine ByteTrack with a Re‑identification model such as OSNet. OSNet uses omni‑scale feature learning: a residual block with multiple convolution streams and a unified aggregation gate to fuse multi‑scale features
arxiv.org
. Despite being lightweight, OSNet achieves state‑of‑the‑art Re‑ID performance across multiple datasets
arxiv.org
.

Segmentation: Train a lightweight segmentation model (e.g., UNet, DeepLabV3 or SegFormer‑B0) to classify pitch, lines, circles and other markings. Synthetic data can be generated by rendering pitch lines on turf backgrounds.

Pose estimation and 3‑D reconstruction: For detailed biomechanical analysis, integrate a monocular pose estimation model. The AthleticsPose dataset (2025) demonstrates that training on authentic sports motions improves monocular 3‑D pose estimation; the authors reduce mean per‑joint position error and show that estimation accuracy is sensitive to camera view
arxiv.org
. Adapting 2‑D/3‑D pose estimators (e.g., OpenPose, BlazePose, MediaPipe or MViT‑based models) will enable stick–player contact recognition and biomechanical metrics.

Event classification

Temporal models are required to classify passes, shots or circle entries from video clips. Start with short clip classification using PyTorchVideo or MoViNet, then progress to temporal action detection models such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) or Transformers. The field‑hockey thesis lists that deep learning models like CNNs and R‑CNNs have been customised for hockey and emphasises the need for event detection datasets
s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
.

Homography and metric mapping

To convert image coordinates to metric pitch coordinates, compute a homography matrix between the video frame and the official pitch template. The planar homography is a 3×3 matrix with eight degrees of freedom that relates points on two planes
docs.opencv.org
. At least four point correspondences (e.g., the corners of the circle arcs or the intersections of the 23 m lines with the side‑lines) are required. Robust estimation should combine line and circle segmentation and use RANSAC to reject outliers. Using the FIH geometry constants (3.66 m chord and 14.63 m arcs) locks scale and improves accuracy. After calibration, track positions can be projected onto the pitch and aggregated into heat‑maps and pressure maps.

Training with Vertex AI

Custom training jobs: Build a custom Docker container or use Vertex’s pre‑built PyTorch/TensorFlow containers. Mount the dataset stored on Cloud Storage and schedule training via Vertex AI Custom Jobs, logging metrics to Vertex Experiments and TensorBoard. Use hyper‑parameter tuning service to sweep learning rates, batch sizes and augmentations.

Model registry: After training, register models (detector, tracker, segmenter, event classifier) in Vertex Model Registry with metadata (mAP, latency, dataset version). Use scorecards to promote models to staging or production.

Batch prediction: For offline analytics, run Vertex Batch Prediction over entire match videos. The service reads frames from Cloud Storage, applies the model and writes results to BigQuery tables or Cloud Storage.

Online prediction: Deploy models to Vertex Endpoints for REST/gRPC inference. Choose machine types with GPUs (A100/L4) for detectors and CPU for segmentation. Configure autoscaling and schedule undeployment to minimise cost.

Geometry, physics and tactical metrics

Once homography has been established, the system can compute physical and tactical metrics:

Ball dynamics: Model ball trajectories with a simple physics engine: the horizontal motion follows Newton’s second law with frictional deceleration F_fric = μ m g, and vertical motion (for flicks) follows y(t) = v₀t − ½ g t². Stick‑ball collisions can be approximated by an impulse that changes momentum. These equations help estimate shot speed and time to goal.

Spatial statistics: Heat‑maps of player positions, ball possessions and circle entries reveal attacking/defensive zones. Pressure maps can be computed by convolving presence maps with a Gaussian kernel. Entropy measures the consistency of movement patterns; low entropy indicates structured play, while high entropy shows unpredictability【10.1177_17479541211008903-fig2.jpg†embed_image】. Collective team behaviours evaluate team structures during different phases; Dynamic game actions encode interactions between attackers and defenders; Game styles cluster game actions into attacking or defensive profiles; and Social networks identify key passers【10.1177_17479541211008903-fig2.jpg†embed_image】.

Expected goals (xG): Adapt soccer’s expected goals models by binning shot locations and computing the probability of scoring from each zone using logistic regression. Input features include shot distance (projected metres), angle, run‑up speed and whether the shot is a forehand/backhand. Over time this yields probability surfaces for each player.

Player‑ball relationships: Compute distance between each player and the ball; assign “in possession” when the distance is below a threshold and the stick orientation points towards the ball. This metric helps determine carry duration and pass lengths.

Database design and golden record
Relational schema

The analytics system needs a database to store players, matches, events, positions, face embeddings and statistics. A relational schema (implemented in BigQuery or Cloud SQL) is proposed:

Table	Key columns	Description
Players	player_id (PK), team_id, name, jersey_number, position, birth_date, height, weight, dominant_hand, face_embedding (vector)	Static information about players; the face_embedding is a 128‑D vector used for facial recognition.
Teams	team_id (PK), name, coach, country, primary_colour, secondary_colour	Metadata about teams.
Stadiums	stadium_id (PK), name, city, country, capacity, length_m, width_m	Details of venues; dimensions come from official rules.
Matches	match_id (PK), home_team, away_team, stadium_id, date, competition, video_uri	Basic match descriptors.
Frames	frame_id (PK), match_id, timestamp_s, homography_matrix (3×3), weather, lighting	Stores per‑frame calibration.
Tracks	track_id (PK), match_id, player_id, start_frame, end_frame, positions (array of (x,y) coordinates in metres), velocity (array), reid_embedding (vector)	Contains continuous trajectories for each player.
Events	event_id (PK), match_id, type, time_s, player_from, player_to, x_m, y_m, attributes (JSON)	High‑level events (passes, shots, circle entries, turnovers, penalty corners).
Stats	stat_id (PK), match_id, player_id, metric, value	Aggregated statistics (e.g., distance covered, passes completed, shots on target, circle entries, expected goals).
Golden record for analytics

The golden record is the minimal set of information extracted from each frame/event required to perform analytics:

Timestamp (t) – seconds from match start.

Player identities (track_id → player_id) – persistent across frames via Re‑ID.

Ball coordinates (x_ball, y_ball) – in metric pitch space.

Player coordinates (x_i, y_i) for each player i.

Event labels – pass, shot, reception, circle entry, penalty corner, etc., with attributes (from/to player, outcome).

Homography matrix – to allow reprojection if needed.

Pose keypoints (optional) – 2‑D or 3‑D joint positions for biomechanical analysis.

This information is sufficient to compute advanced metrics like expected goals, team shape compactness, pressing intensity, pass networks and player heat‑maps without revisiting raw video frames.

System architecture and workflow

【flow_diagram.png†embed_image】The system architecture is designed as a pipeline of micro‑services that ingest data, train models, perform inference, store results and visualise analytics:

Data ingestion & labelling: Raw videos are ingested, frames extracted and labelled using Label Studio. The pitch template and calibration keypoints are stored in the calibration bucket.

Training & calibration: Vertex AI custom jobs train object detectors, segmenters, trackers and event models. Calibration routines compute homography matrices for each clip using line and circle detections.

Inference & homography: Inference services (Vertex Endpoints or GPU‑enabled GKE pods) apply detectors and trackers to incoming frames, update player tracks and compute metric coordinates via homography.

Analytics & storage: A processing service aggregates track data and events into BigQuery tables and relational databases. Additional jobs compute heat‑maps, xG surfaces, pass networks and team structures.

Visualisation & frontend: A web application (React or Next.js) queries the database and displays interactive dashboards, 2‑D/3‑D replays and overlays on video streams. The UI can filter by player, event or zone and supports annotation review.

Game engine & live streaming: A game engine (Unity/Unreal or Three.js) uses track data to animate players and ball in real time; the same data feed can overlay information onto live streams. Google’s Live Stream API receives RTMP/SRT feeds, transcodes to HLS/DASH and allows a side‑car frame‑tap to send selected frames to the inference service.

Backend services

Ingest service: Cloud Run function triggered by file uploads; extracts frames/clips and writes metadata.

Training pipeline: Implemented with Kubeflow Pipelines on Vertex; orchestrates data preparation, training, evaluation and model registration.

Inference service: Deployed on GKE Autopilot or Vertex Online Prediction; provides gRPC endpoint that accepts frames and returns detections/tracks/events. Utilises asynchronous concurrency to maximise GPU utilisation.

Aggregator: Cloud Functions or Dataflow job that consumes inference results from Pub/Sub, computes metrics and stores records in BigQuery and Cloud SQL.

API layer: GraphQL or REST API deployed on Cloud Run to serve frontend queries (match list, player stats, event timelines, heat‑maps, xG surfaces).

Frontend design

【field-hockey-autodata-wide-1600x500.png†embed_image】A modern analytics dashboard should include:

Shot & goal maps: radial charts showing shot locations coloured by outcome (goal, saved, blocked, off target) and separated into field shots, penalty corners and penalty strokes. The dotted half‑circle indicates the striking circle. Users can filter by player or by phase.

Attack zones: vector diagrams showing player runs and passes with arrow directions and zone statistics; shading highlights the area of the field from which most attacks originate.

Match summary: bar charts comparing ball possession, shots on goal, circle entries, penalty corners, penalty strokes, turnovers and disciplinary cards for each team.

Time‑series graphs: slider or timeline to navigate through the match; overlay events on the video player; allow playback at variable speed with detection overlays.

Interactive replay: 2‑D top‑down and optional 3‑D views generated by the game engine; users can pan, zoom and step through frames; players are rendered as icons with jersey numbers and names.

Customization: allow coaches to create custom filters (e.g., only passes into the circle) and export clips or statistics for presentations.

The frontend should be containerised with Docker, served from Cloud Run or Cloud Front and integrated with Google Identity for secure access.

Backend implementation and Google AI integration

To implement the pipeline using Google AI Pro resources:

Project setup: Create a new GCP project and enable Vertex AI, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Run, GKE Autopilot and Live Stream API. Use Identity Access Management (IAM) roles to restrict permissions.

Artifact registry & containers: Store custom Docker images for training and inference in Artifact Registry. Each image should include dependencies (PyTorch, torchvision, OpenCV, TensorFlow where needed), code to load models and serve predictions.

Training: Use Vertex AI Custom Job to run training scripts. Example Python skeleton:

from vertexai.training import CustomJob

job = CustomJob(
    display_name='yolov8-training',
    worker_pool_specs=[{
        'machine_spec': {
            'machine_type': 'a2-highgpu-1g',
            'accelerator_type': 'NVIDIA_TESLA_A100',
            'accelerator_count': 1,
        },
        'replica_count': 1,
        'container_spec': {
            'image_uri': 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<project>/hockey/yolov8-training:latest',
            'args': ['python', 'train.py', '--data', 'gs://hockeyvision/02_labels/detection_yolo/train.yaml', '--epochs', '100', '--imgsz', '640'],
        },
    }]
)
job.run()


Hyper‑parameter tuning: Wrap the custom training job in a HyperparameterTuningJob specifying the metric to minimise (validation loss) and parameter ranges (learning rate, confidence thresholds).

Model deployment: After training, call vertexai.model.Model.upload() to register models and create an endpoint with automatic scaling.

Batch prediction: Use BatchPredictionJob to process entire match videos. The job reads frames, applies the model and writes detections to BigQuery. Running batch jobs over pre‑segmented frames reduces cost versus running real‑time endpoints for archived analysis.

Live streaming: Configure Live Stream API to accept RTMP ingestion; a Cloud Run side‑car service subscribes to the streaming frames and posts them to the inference endpoint. The results are published to Pub/Sub and consumed by the overlay and analytics services.

Compute resources and cost

Training: For object detection and segmentation, use GPUs (A100 or L4). A YOLOv8‑small model typically trains within a few hours on a single A100; at ~US$2.50–3.00 per hour, 10 training runs (with tuning) may cost $100–150. Segmentation and event models may require longer epochs but can often use smaller GPUs (L4). Vertex AI hyper‑parameter tuning service charges extra for parallel trials.

Inference: Deploy detectors on Vertex AI endpoints using n1-standard-4 or a2-highgpu-1g machine types. The cost is driven by the number of hours the endpoint is running; schedule automatic undeployment outside of match days. For live streaming, using GKE Autopilot with L4 GPUs or CPU‑only models (for segmentation) can reduce cost. Real‑time analytics may require 30 FPS inference; compute budgets accordingly.

Storage: Storing high‑definition match videos at 1 GB per half yields ~8 GB per match. Cloud Storage multi‑region pricing is ~US$0.026/GB/month; BigQuery costs are pay‑per‑query (first 1 TB monthly free). Annotation storage and BigQuery tables incur minimal cost compared to video.

Labeling: If using Vertex Data Labeling service or human annotators, allocate budget (approx. $0.05–$0.10 per labelled object) for 2–3k labelled frames (~$150–$300). Label Studio on GKE can reduce costs but requires manual annotation time.

Additional context‑aware enhancements
Facial recognition and player identity

【keypoint-annotation-pixel.webp†embed_image】Face recognition models (e.g., FaceNet, ArcFace) can be trained or fine‑tuned on player headshots to produce 128‑D embeddings that uniquely identify players. These embeddings can be stored in the Players.face_embedding column and compared via cosine similarity to assign identities to detected faces. When integrated with OSNet for full‑body Re‑ID, this reduces ID switching and allows recognition even when jersey numbers are occluded. Facial data collection must comply with privacy regulations; obtain consent and follow data protection guidelines.

Strong side, skill profiles and probability models

Strong side: Determine each player’s dominant hand and foot (stored in the database) and observe whether they prefer forehand or backhand shots. Compute the probability of success for shots from each side and zone.

Skill profiles: Cluster players by features such as sprint speed, pass length distribution, stick‑handling precision and heat‑map coverage. Use unsupervised clustering (k‑means, DBSCAN) to derive player archetypes (e.g., play‑maker, finisher, dribbler, defender).

Formation and tactics: Compute convex hulls or Voronoi tessellations for each team at every time step to describe team shape. Calculate team compactness and width. Compare to soccer analytics frameworks (e.g., pressing intensity, xT (expected threat)) and adapt them to hockey’s larger width and smaller length. Use network analysis of passes to identify key distributors and build social networks【10.1177_17479541211008903-fig2.jpg†embed_image】.

Unpredictability and entropy: The performance analysis framework suggests measuring the degree of consistency in movement patterns via entropy【10.1177_17479541211008903-fig2.jpg†embed_image】. Compute entropy of positional distributions or pass sequences to quantify adaptability; high entropy may correlate with unpredictable play.

Multi‑camera and 3‑D extensions

Future versions could add behind‑goal cameras or drones for multi‑view reconstruction. Using camera calibration and triangulation, 3‑D joint positions can be obtained and used for biomechanical analysis or training of skills such as drag‑flicks. The multi‑view geometry and PnL (Points‑and‑Lines) calibration methods allow accurate field registration
docs.opencv.org
.

Testing with full‑match videos

Select an international match: Obtain a high‑quality full‑match video (e.g., a recent FIH Pro League game) with permission.

Annotate a subset: Label ~2k frames for detection and ~200 clips for events. Use these to fine‑tune detectors and event models.

Run batch inference: Apply the detector, tracker and homography pipeline to the entire match via Vertex Batch Prediction. Store detections and tracks in BigQuery.

Event spotting: Run event classifiers to identify passes, circle entries, penalty corners, shots and goals. Manually verify a subset to compute precision, recall and F1 scores.

Generate analytics: Compute heat‑maps, pass networks, xG surfaces, pressing intensity and team shapes; visualise them in the frontend. Evaluate whether the metrics align with expert judgement. Use ByteTrack metrics (MOTA, IDF1, HOTA) and detection mAP to assess model performance. Evaluate homography by measuring reprojection error of known pitch points.

Iterate: Use misclassified events and tracking errors to refine the dataset, update the models and improve the pipeline.

Containerisation and deployment

Backend containers: Each micro‑service (ingest, training, inference, aggregator, API) should have its own Dockerfile specifying base image (e.g., python:3.11-slim), code, model weights, dependencies (OpenCV, PyTorch). Use multi‑stage builds to reduce size. Store images in Artifact Registry and deploy via Cloud Run or GKE Autopilot.

Frontend container: Build the React/Next.js application and serve it via Node.js or Nginx. The Dockerfile should install dependencies, copy the build and expose port 80. Deploy to Cloud Run with automatic scaling.

Infrastructure as code: Use Terraform or Cloud Deployment Manager to provision buckets, BigQuery datasets, Pub/Sub topics, GKE clusters and service accounts. This ensures reproducibility and version control.

Agentic automation: For repeating tasks (e.g., nightly batch analytics or scheduled endpoint undeploy), use Cloud Scheduler to trigger Cloud Run jobs or Cloud Functions. Example: schedule a Cloud Run job that queries matches from the previous day, runs batch prediction and updates statistics.

Example Dockerfile for inference service
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY src/ .
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]


requirements.txt should include fastapi, uvicorn, pytorch, opencv-python-headless, numpy, scikit-learn, etc. The main.py file defines a /predict endpoint that accepts a base64‑encoded frame, runs detection, tracking and homography, and returns JSON with bounding boxes, track IDs and metric coordinates.

Future research and considerations

Self‑supervised learning: Leveraging self‑supervised methods for player and ball representations could reduce dependence on manual labels. Contrastive learning on unlabelled match footage may improve Re‑ID embeddings and event classification.

3‑D simulation and game engine: Integrate physics‑based 3‑D simulation (Unity/Unreal) to reconstruct realistic stick and ball motions. Use the context‑aware data to drive synthetic training scenes and generate augmented data for rare events.

Comparisons to soccer analytics: Many hockey analytics metrics have analogues in football (expected goals, threat models, packing metrics, passing networks). Comparing results across sports can inspire new features; for example, hockey’s larger width means wing space is more valuable than central space, so xG models may weigh angles differently.

Ethical and legal issues: Ensure that data collection (particularly facial data) complies with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR). Obtain consent from players and clubs and provide opt‑out mechanisms. When commercialising the product, verify that training data licences allow proprietary use and respect broadcast rights.

Conclusion

This report has outlined an end‑to‑end strategy to build a context‑aware field‑hockey analytics system. Starting from the official rules and field dimensions, we designed data schemas, labelling protocols and a modular machine‑learning pipeline. The proposed model suite uses open‑source detectors (YOLOv8/9), trackers (ByteTrack)

, segmentation and temporal event models. Homography aligns camera frames to metric coordinates

, enabling physical and tactical metrics. A relational database stores players, matches, events and analytics, and a React‑based frontend presents heat‑maps, shot charts and interactive replays. Google Vertex AI provides managed training, hyper‑parameter tuning, prediction services and a cost‑effective infrastructure. Together, these components form a robust foundation for transforming raw field‑hockey footage into actionable insights for coaches, analysts and fans.
